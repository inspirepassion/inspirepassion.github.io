## Work experience
### Graduate Research Assistant, UC Merced, Merced, CA
(Aug, 2020 - Jan, 2024)

Conducted research in defending against adversarial attacks on deep learning models. Developed and prototyped 50+ novel models (Python), designed experiments, and evaluated results, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 32%.

Collaborated closely with faculty, contributing to 4 publications in peer-reviewed conferences. Mentored first-year graduate students in academic progress and mental health, and mentored undergraduates in research methodologies.

### Teaching Assistant, UC Merced, Merced, CA 
(Aug, 2016 - Dec, 2023)

Collaborated closely with faculties to develop course materials and coding exercises, with a commitment to student learning and success. Led weekly lab for 200+ students in Object-Oriented Programming in C++, Python, and Java.

Provided visual aids to explain complex concepts with clarity. Increased student engagement by 10% with personalized assistance and interpersonal skills. Enhanced student retention rate to 94% and teaching effectiveness rate to 93.5%.

### Instructor for Machine Learning and Data Science, Digital Media Academy, Stanford, CA
(Jun, 2019 - Aug, 2019)

Developed 20 advanced ML projects (Python) that cover computer vision, NLP, RL, and video/image processing. Managed teaching team and delivered courses to 150+ students, receiving a satisfaction rate of 96% in the survey.
